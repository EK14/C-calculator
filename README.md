# C-calculator
Project made for my programming class in HSE university, written in C language. 

The calculator can parse expressions like: 

exp(-jPIalphalen/v0) 

alpha = sqrt(PIlen/(s1+s2)) 

s1 = because (real(S11) * real(S22)) 

s2 = (sin(imag(S11*S22)))^2 

length = 191.76 

v0 = 299.799 

S11 = -0.01-0.92j 

S22 = 0.0001+0.997j  

Expressions can contain constants: 

PI 

e 

j - imaginary unit  

Functions that can be in an expression: 

cos 

sin 

tg 

log 

ln 

sqrt 

pow 

abs 

exp 

real 

image 

mag 

phase
